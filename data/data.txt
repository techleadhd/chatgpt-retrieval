Makers enabled me to 
change my life. I wanted 
 
to do something which I was 
passionate about, so I made 
the scary decision to change 
careers and pursue software 
development. I now work 
at one of the hottest tech 
startups and work with some 
of the most brilliant and 
talented people Œ building 
amazing solutions, learning 
at an accelerated pace and 
I love I what do. I never 
thought I would actually say 
that I look forward to going 
to work.

The time I spent at Makers was not 
easy. During the course there was a 
constant feeling of being on your back 
foot, falling behind or otherwise just 
not understanding anything. It was only 
after I completed the course did I see 
the real merit of what I had been taught. 
Makers doesn™t just teach you how to 
code, it teaches you how to be a coder. 
From soft skills to team management, to 
understanding acceptance and rejection 
during the job hunt, Makers has given 
me a well-rounded view of the industry 
and one that I hope will continue long 
into my career. The holistic approach to 
development is a wonderful bonus as well, 
and all the coaches and staff are friendly 
and helpful.

Major congratulations for joining Makers - 
we™re really looking forward to helping you 
˜nd your feet as a developer. I wanted to say 
a quick hello and explain why we™re excited 
to have you on board. 
First of all, we pride ourselves on being 
much more than just a coding bootcamp. 
We know that Makers changes lives. You 
can see this from reading the stories of 
various students - like this 
mother-of-four 
Kate Morris
, or Jordan Roberts who 
left law 
to retrain into tech
, or the countless other 
student stories you can 
read on our blog.
 
We™re looking forward to hearing your story. 
Secondly, we know that your relationship 
with Makers doesn™t end when the training 
does. ‚Once a Maker, Always a Maker ™ is 
something we pride ourselves on, and you 
can 
read more about our alumni community 
here.
 We™re excited that you™ll get to join this 
group once you ˜nish training. 
A message 
from our 
founder, 
Evgeny 
Shadchnev
Lastly, I wanted to share why  
I started Makers. Essentially,  
I believed that there was a 
better way to link education to  
employment. Our goal was (and  
still is) to help people become  
developers and start exciting new  
careers. Yet, our work has bigger  
implications in terms of the impact  
on the society that our developers  
will have. You can 
read more about  
my thoughts on that here.

Essentially, the tech  
revolution is affecting 
 
every single industry  
 
and every single business,  

and it ™s only getting started.  
Hopefully you™ll learn from us, just by 
virtue of being on campus, that looking 

after each other matters. That everyone 

matters, and everyone should have a 

voice. That pro˜t shouldn™t be the only 

motive in life. Those feelings have a 

place in the professional world. That 

mental health is just as important as 

physical health.
That it ™s okay not to work  
with an employer that is  

harming the society and  

the environment. That it ™s  

important to pay it forward,  

just because you can. That  
 
we need to learn to have 

difficult conversations  

about equality, reverse  

sexism, invisible privilege  

and other difficult topics,  

in order to move forward  

as the tech industry and  

society in general.
You will build the next generation  
of technology, guided by values you 

pick up here, at Makers. I hope you 

build good things.
Best of luck, Evgeny

In 2013, co-founders Evgeny  
 
and Rob met at Forward  
Labs and got to talking about 
the problems people have 
learning to code. Evgeny  
had trained as a software  
developer at Imperial College  
and as he was trying to build  
out his team he discovered a  
lack of qualified developers  
on the market. Rob had  
been through the arduous  
process of teaching himself to  
programme through a book  
on Objective C.
 
They both saw that traditional 
education was broken. The vision they 
had was for Makers to be an alternative 
to university and a vocational route 
into a job as a software developer. 
Makers would train people to 
 
become software engineers in only 
three months Š it would be a platform 
 
to provide the world™s most e˚cient 
introduction to programming 
principles.
Back then, Rob wrote what still 
 
rings true today:
ﬁMakers is not for everyone. 
Some people are okay 
investing the time and money  
into getting a computer 
science degree and that ™s  
great. Others are okay with  
the inefficiencies in teaching  
themselves and just want  
to learn enough to get by.  
For the rest, we™re building  
Makers.ﬂ

We™re 
 
proud  
 
to have:
Ł
 
Trained over 1700 Makers (on 
 
average 35% of them were women);
 
Ł
 
Connected them to over 250 of 
London™s top technology companies 
(Deliveroo, British Gas, Starling Bank, 
Financial Times, Compare The Market.
com, Tesco, among others);
 
Ł
 
Grown to a team of over 40 people, 
with the philosophy of ‚ trust over fear ™;
 
Ł
 
Been included in 2018™s UpScale 
cohort, which aims to support the 
growth of the UK™s most exciting and 
innovative companies Š we™re excited 
to leverage that to widen our impact 
on the tech industry.
We™re proud to have proven 
 
that a complete beginner 
 
can get an amazing job 
 
in software development 
 
in just a few months.
In the coming years we™ll double-down on 
making our course even more accessible and 
inclusive; helping our Makers learn a wider 
range of skills; working with even more hiring 
partners across all industries, so that many 
more thousands of newly trained software 
developers can start careers they truly love.

Hi, I™m Dana. I™ve worked in the tech 
industry for almost a decade. I have been 
with Makers since 2014. Here, we believe 
that world-class developers are not only 
technically skilled but are also strong 
communicators and collaborators. This 
is why we have an emotional intelligence 
curriculum, which I™ve developed. 
 
I wanted to take a few 
moments to welcome you 
onto the course and to set our 
expectations around mindset.
Makers is a fast-moving environment. 
Students almost always feel behind in the 
amount that they have to absorb as there™s 
so much to learn each day. The course is 
designed that way. I encourage students to 
try to make peace with doing your best, as 
stressing about not being able to complete 
everything ultimately slows you down. 
What we 
believe: 
A message 
from Dana, 
our Chief 
Joy Officer

Learning is the point, not  
completing everything. It™s  
easy to get caught up in the  
Makers journey and forget  
this.  
As long as you™re doing your best and 
focusing on learning, not completion, 
you™re likely to be progressing in a more 
optimal way. There™s a ˜ne line between 
pushing yourself and over-doing 
 
it. With proper attention to self-care, 
you can be sensitive to that line and 
avoid burnout.
At Makers we value a sense of 
autonomy in work and learning. 
Students engage with self-led learning 
which means they are in control of 
their journeys. You™re expected to set 
and take charge of your own goals, 
which is quite a new concept for 
most (especially those coming from 
traditional education, where there are 
generally clear hoops to jump through). 
It can take some time adjusting to that 
and can sometimes leave you feeling 
out of control.
Certainty is a core human need but is 
often a rare commodity at Makers, as 
the curriculum is deliberately designed 
to keep you on your toes as you have 
 
a series of coding curve-balls thrown 
 
at you˛Š˛being aware of this helps 
prevent burnout from creeping in.
Remind yourself to trust the process 
and reach for what is certain in your 
 
life: your support network (Makers sta˝
 
/resources, cohort members, family, 
friends, hobbies, values etc.).
Drop expectations that you might 
 
have had about how the course should 
go for you and try to be present, while 
allowing the process to take you on 
the journey. If you value a high level 
of control in your life then this is the 
perfect opportunity to practice being 
˙exible and adaptable as those qualities 
rank high in what makes a great 
developer.
Welcome to your Makers 
journey. I™m looking forward 
to supporting you.

If you are using a Mac, 
 a 
 
 
of the tools 
you will need to create a dev 

environment on your computer.
Henry and Emma,
 two of the Makers 
assistant coaches, have written about 

setting up a Cloud9 AWS developer 
environment that  
you can use on any operating systems  
-
if you are a Windows user, we
recommend using this environment.
Passing the PreCourse
Nikesh™s post
 on passing the PreCourse 
is a helpful summary on what the goal  

of the PreCourse is, and how an 

e˝ectively ful˜lled PreCourse can set  

you up for success later on with our  

hiring partners. 
- You are expected to work independently
as much as possible
- You should be working on improving
your problem solving processes
- PreCourse is an opportunity to get
to know your cohort and learn how
to learn from others
We hope that you found these  
links useful.  
If you have any questions about Makers, 
don™t hesitate to 
contact us
 - and please, 

do come around for a Q&A session, or 

a Demo Day, even before your course 

starts, we would love to have you. 
Prepare for 
PreCourse

On the first day of the PreCourse you will receive  
a link to Teachable which will contain all the  

PreCourse material. You will also have an invitation  

to join Slack - our chat tool. This is what you will be  

using for all communication.

Tips for 
remote 
working
From Diana Constantinou
1. Organisation
 
Structure to your day is important.  
Routines are important for  
normalising this new way of working.  
Planning out your day with consistent  
tasks will get you into a ˙ow with  
working.  This includes the planning  
 
of breaks, lunch and physical activity.  
Create a good routine with  
short exercise breaks. 
Moving and stretching our bodies  
energises the brain. The truth is,  
endorphins are produced when  
exercising, which increases happiness 
and interest levels.
2. Create a workspace
 
Obviously an o˚ce is ideal, but 
not always possible.  Try to create  
an o˚ce space within the space  
you have available  This will set out  
clearly when you are working (in the 
space); and when you are relaxing.  
Prepare a conducive workspace. Apart  
from having a high-speed internet  
connection and a reliable router, get  
a comfortable chair and think about a  
second monitor or in the least a clear  
display.  You are going to be staring at  
the screen all day, o˝ and on.  
If you cohabit try closing the 
door when you are trying to  
focus.  
Clear communication is important.  
Creating rules around video calls, or  
focus time reduces mishaps due to 
poor communication. For example,  
when the door is closed or when my 
headphones are on–..
It is a good habit to mute your 
microphone during conference calls  
(unless you™re speaking) to minimise  
the amount of audio feedback and  
random sounds that interrupt the  
conversation.

3. Research/ stay up to date
 
The good news is, you are not alone. 
The world is transitioning from physically  
working to remote.  There are a load of 
really useful blogs and websites.  Try to  
follow some people that are similar to  
you and your context, follow them to 
pick up tips.  Again, just a list to get you  
started and in no way complete:
The Five Levels of Remote Working,  
a blog aimed to maximise your  
effectiveness as a remote worker
The Stress of Remote Working, a blog 
by a software developer who has 
worked from home for some time now
How to thrive working from home, a 
blog on some tips for effective home 
working
What is it like to work as a remote 
software developer, a blog by current 
software developers working remotely
NHS blog - every mind matters, some 
medical information on working from 
home
Just Giving blog on working from 
home
BBC news article with advice for 
working from home during COVID-19
4. Dress properly
 
Resist the temptation to stay in your  
pyjamas 24/7.  Remember how you  
dress will also a˝ect your mental 
perception.  It ™s important to follow  
routines you would have normally put 
in place.  Having a breakfast routine,  
getting ready for work, and o˚cially  
getting started.
5. Concentration
 
Cut o˝ slack: that said, know when  
to shut o˝ Slack, or any other way  
to communicate (like email) and just  
focus on the work. So many hours of  
productivity can be lost just by reading 
other people conversations.
Consider keeping the television turned  
o˝. It can be a big distraction. The  
radio or music on YouTube might be 
better if you are the type who works 
well with some background music.  
Relaxing music creates an unwinding 
mood, whereas up tempo soundtracks  
keep the energy level high.  But you  
just need to be aware of how noise is  
a˝ecting your productivity.
Stay o˝ social media. We are all guilty  
of this one from time to time, and social 
media can be one giant time-waster if  
you™re not careful.

11

6. For Parents
 
Keep children in your plans. Due  
to school closure, children may 
also be around at home. Plan and  
schedule some activities to occupy 
them while you work.
Have staggered lunchtime  
to spend with children; for  
instance, one partner can  
have a lunch break at 11  
am-12 pm, and the other  
breaks at 12 pm-1 pm, so  
2 hours are spent with  
children.  
Think about taking Saturday as  
a school day, and giving them  
one work day o˝, better chosen  
for your busiest work day. It is  
important to keep at least one  
common weekend day together.  
For all we know, working with  
children around us might become  
the new norm.

Education at Makers is 
designed to be empowering.  
Being a software engineer  
means looking at any problem  
you encounter and believing  
ﬁWith thoughtful effort, I can 
solve this.ﬂ
 
We trust you with three responsibilities:
Ł
 
Deciding what to aim for 
 
(your goals).
Ł
 
Determining how to get there 
 
(your plan).
Ł
 
Getting insight into your progress 
(self-assessment).
We believe that you are the best 
 
person to lead these things. This 
 
way, when someone asks you how 
it ™s going, you should know pretty 
accurately how you™re doing as 
 
a software engineer, where you 
 
want to get to, and how you™re 
 
going to get there.
You will know when to put in more 
e˝ort, when to slow down, change 
focus, employ your strengths 
 
or strengthen your weaknesses. 
 
You will know when you are ready 
 
to apply for jobs. You™re in the 
 
driving seat.
What are your 
responsibilities?
14

15
15
What are  
 
the coaches™  
 
responsibilities?
So what™s our job?
Ł
 
To support you with the above.
Ł
 
To provide an environment 
with the tools and motivation 
necessary to achieve your goals.
It ™s our job to give you the  
prompts and starting-points  
to train the habits of planning  
and self-assessment required 
to be a successful self-led  
learner.
 
And then there™s the matter of making the 
environment here as rich in opportunities 
to learn as possible. 
 
 
If you™re not sure whether your code 
is readable or not, it should be easy to 
learn how to determine that, execute it, 
and then engage productively with the 
task of improving your code. Moreover, 
the atmosphere and people around you 
should inspire you to be better
Not everyone will come here  
knowing how to take control  
of their own journey Š and  
that™s fine.

Curriculum

17
17
We have a carefully thought-
out curriculum which  
advances you in software  
development week by week. 
Students learn in peer-to-
peer environments facilitated  
by experienced facilitators.
Ł
 
Students pair programme for the 
majority of the day.
Ł
 
Daily workshops & code reviews are 
led by coaches.
Ł
 
Access to the Makers Students Slack 
community
Our course is designed to give you the 
skills you need for working in a real 
development team. From day one you™ll 
be participating in stand-ups, retros and 
pair programming. You™ll also learn about 
TDD and agile, and through the course 
you™ll manage your own projects using 
di˝erent project management tools that 
align with these principles. 
Much of the course will be spent with 
programming in Ruby, but the Makers 
students ˜nish the course
 language-
agnostic
: meaning that they will be able 
to programme in any language. 
Our course is constantly being developed 
and re˜ned over time, but hopefully this 
will give you an idea of what kinds of 
things you™ll be working on.
